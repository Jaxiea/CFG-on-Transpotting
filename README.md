# CFG-on-Transpotting
Ongoing school project on Context Free Grammar on Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting

This is a project in the Taaltheorie en Taalmodelen class at the Kunstmatige Intelligentie course from the University of Amsterdam. 

The project is an effort to parse from the first 1000 words of Welsh's novel Trainspotting, and then generate sentences from the context free grammar obtained. 

The project is ongoing.
